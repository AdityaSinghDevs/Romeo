ROMEO is an AI-powered SaaS platform for Indian micro-influencers and SMEs, targeting Instagram/X with content generation, scheduling, and analytics. I’m building a production-grade, mobile-responsive React + Vite SPA with a cyberpunk-themed UI (Suitable colours, Orbitron font, glowing animations). Use React Router, Material-UI, Styled-Components, Framer Motion, Chart.js, React Hook Form, React Toastify. The MVP has 5 routes: Dashboard, Content Generator, Scheduler, Analytics, Settings. I’m in Chunk 1 (UI), using mock data and placeholder hooks for future Firebase/Langflow integration. My budget is $0, so use free tools. Follow best practices for performance, accessibility, and cyberpunk aesthetics. Generate code that’s clean, modular, and awe-inspiring, leveraging my AI/NLP/web dev skills.
